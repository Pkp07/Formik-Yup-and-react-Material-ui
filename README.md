A small example on How to integrate Formik and Yup with React Material Ui ?

Handling react form is really hefty work, As a beginner, I felt a lot of confusion to learn and code, for that I have visited a lot of sites to clarify doubts that arise while I am coding. among them  react form validation is one that made me scratch my head. Luckily I found a solution for form validation online i.e. Formik and Yup combination.
I love this combination after using them for form validation, initially, I found it very difficult to integrate formik and yup into my code because I already completed coding all required functionalities left validation. now to integrate the formik and yup I need to change some parts of the code but don't know where to start.
So here I am uploading a small example with formik and yup along with react material ui template. hoping this might help beginners who struggling to validate a form.
